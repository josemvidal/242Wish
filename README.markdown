A Google App Engine web application for handling the submission of code files by students. 
It is currently published at [i-am-done.appspot.com](http://i-am-done.appspot.com).

The basic workflow is as follows:


1. A user (teacher) can create a class and a homework for it, resulting in a URL. 
2. Students (anyone with a google account) can then visit this URL and upload their various program files. You can only see your own uploads.
3. The teacher can see all the uploads by all the students, with timestamps, and market up using prettify.
